#Pinyin.nvim

I kinda want to learn Chinese, so I wrote this to help write vowel tones.


## Usage

In insert mode, press `<ctrl>[1-4]` to insert the corresponding tone mark on
the most recent `a`, `e`, `i`, `o`, or `u`. This can be done either during or
after after typing the word, so `Biānchéng` can be typed either as
```
Bia <ctrl> 1 nche <ctrl> 2 ng
```
or
```
Biancheng <ctrl>2 <ctrl>1
```
